## Adding your members to your new system
You obviously won’t want to be alone on your new system. You can easily add default and administrator users, send your system link to whom you want to give access to. Proceed to admin > user management where you will be greeted with a list of users who have signed in using steam. Click on your chosen user and edit the users permissions to your liking.
