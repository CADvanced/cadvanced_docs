# Configuring server settings and the in-game plugin

Using our in-game plugin is an easy process. Navigate to admin > preferences and enter applicable information, when entering an API key you must remember it or copy it. Then navigate to admin > downloads where you can download the plugin via GitHub. The plugin is installed the same way as any other drag and drop plugin but the name must remain as **“cadvanced_mdt”** any discrepancies **will** cause errors. Once installed, navigate to the mdt_config.lua.sample file where you must edit the file name to **“mdt_config.lua”**. You then are required to make edits within the **mdt_config.lua**, your API token and cad URL must be exactly the same on your CADS website and the mdt config file.

Using the MDT in game is simple, assign yourself as an active officer and type `/mdt` to open it.
