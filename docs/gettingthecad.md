### Begin your trial
To get started you must start your seven day free trial, all customers are entilted to a trial period as we want you to experience our system before making any commitments! You can easily get started with our seven day free trial, which gives you access to **all** features of our paid plan for free! When your free trial ends you are welcome to continue onto our paid plan which is just £4 per month or £40 per year (£3.33 per/m) if you wish to pay yearly. All features are available to all customers we do not have any tier system. To get started with our trial head over to [our website](https://cadvanced.app) and choose "try for free". 

## Accessing your system 
After activating your trial you will recieve a few emails from us, you will see an important email that contains your **cad url**, this is the url you use to access your cad and send to other people. You can then sign in using steam and begin the setup of your cad in our next guide.
